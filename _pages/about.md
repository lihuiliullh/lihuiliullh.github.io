I am an assistant professor at Wayne State University. My research interests lie in **neural symbolic AI**, **large language models**, **augmented retrieval**, **knowledge graph reasoning**, and **graph neural networks**.

I got my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2024. Before that, I obtained my M.S degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Software (2014-2017) and B.S degree from HuaZhong University of Science and Technology (2010-2014). 

**I have several Ph.D. positions available and am always looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my team. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach out to me via email with the subject line 'Ph.D. Application -- [Your Name].'. (hw6926 at wayne dot edu)**

**I also have multiple internship positions available. Please contact me if you are interested.**
